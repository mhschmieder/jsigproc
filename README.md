# jsigproc

A Java library for working with signal processing core concepts, including basic DSP

This library presents Java implementations of core textbook concepts and algorithms for DSP and other signal processing concepts and generalized filters, all based on public domain knowledge. It unfortunately cannot include some more advanced filters as those tend to have patents involved. Nevertheless, it can form a building block framework for such code bases.
